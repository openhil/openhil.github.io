# Open Hardware in the Loop Community

Welcome to Open Hardare in the loop (HiL) community ðŸ‘‹

We are a forum for software engineers, hardware hackers, QA teams, and embedded board manufacturers to come together and have conversations about Hardware in the Loop (HiL or HitL) systems. We welcome folks to present their systems in the forum, ask questions about HiL CI/CD pipelines and document our knowledge to help everyone along the path to build out an effective system.

## What is Hardare in the Loop?

Hardware in the Loop is a system that enables testing of software applications on real hardware. 

- It's a feedback loop for teams to test software changes in a controlled environement before deploying applications to production (embedded IoT, fleet management usecases)
- It's a QA pipeline to test if your software works well with new hardware under synthetic, stress testing or real-life workloads (Factory floor, complinance testing usecases)
- It's a way to test systems end-to-end by controlling external factors (power, network, environment) and create a diverse range of test scenarios to catch mission critical failures. 

Hardware in the loop helps ensure everything is functioning as intended in an environment making your teams deploy not just as fast as possible but as confidently as possible. 

## Who are we?

The community was started in 2024 by fellow HiL system builders who have been: 

- tired of rebuilding the wheel constantly.
- Tired of having no standardized documentation on how to start thinking about Hardware in the Loop. 
- Tired of proprietory, expensive hardware automation jigs built for limited use cases. 

The community is meant to be a way forward to pool our collective expertise, document our past learnings and present it as a guide for anyone looking to building their own HiL system.

## Where can you find us?

You are more than welcome to join our community chat over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vt6GYwesb3) even if you are looking to learn about Hardware in the Loop. Please introduce yourself, tell us about your work, and your interests.

We are looking to spread awareness about the community, talk to more people, and speak about HiL in conferences and meetups. Please share the website as much as you can!
